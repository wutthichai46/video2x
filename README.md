## üåü Version 6.0.0

**[Download Windows Installer](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/releases/download/6.0.0-beta.5/video2x-qt6-windows-amd64-installer.exe)**

**TL;DR: Version 6.0.0 is a complete rewrite of the Video2X project in C/C++, featuring a faster, more efficient architecture, cross-platform support, vastly improved output quality, and a new GUI and installer for easy setup on Windows.**

![6.0.0-screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c6f4cd9-2cca-4deb-a886-f9f225962866)

Version 6.0.0 is a complete rewrite of this project in C/C++. It:

- genuinely works this time, with much less hassle compared to the 5.0.0 beta;
- is blazing fast, thanks to the new optimized pipeline and the efficiency of C/C++;
- is cross-platform, available now for both Windows and Linux;
- offers significantly better output quality with Anime4K v4 and RealESRGAN;
- supports Anime4K v4 and all custom MPV-compatible GLSL shaders;
- includes support for RealESRGAN (all three models) via ncnn and Vulkan;
- requires zero additional disk space during processing, just space for the final output; and
- exports a standard C function for easy integration into other projects! (documentations are on the way)

Support for RealCUGAN and frame interpolation with RIFE are coming soon.

## [ü™ü Download for Windows](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/releases/latest)

You can download the latest Windows release from the [releases page](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/releases/latest). For basic GUI usage, refer to the [GUI wiki page](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki/GUI). If you're unable to download directly from GitHub, try the [mirror](https://files.k4yt3x.com/Projects/Video2X/latest). The GUI currently supports the following languages:

- English (United States)
- ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠ÊñáÔºà‰∏≠ÂõΩÔºâ
- Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûÔºàÊó•Êú¨Ôºâ
- Portugu√™s (Portugal)

## [üêß Install on Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/video2x-git)

You can install Video2X on Arch Linux using the [video2x-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/video2x-git) package or download pre-compiled binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/releases/latest). If you'd like to build from source, refer to the [PKGBUILD](PKGBUILD) file for a general overview of the required packages and commands. If you'd prefer not to compile the program from source, consider using the container image below.

## [üì¶ Container Image](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/pkgs/container/video2x)

Video2X container images are available on the GitHub Container Registry for easy deployment on Linux and macOS. If you already have Docker/Podman installed, only one command is needed to start upscaling a video. For more information on how to use Video2X's Docker image, please refer to the [documentations](https://github.com/K4YT3X/video2x/wiki/Container).

## [üìî Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gWEwcA9y57EsxwOjmLNmNMXPsafw0kGo) (Outdated: 5.0.0-beta7)

You can use Video2X on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) **for free** if you don't have a powerful GPU of your own. You can borrow a powerful GPU (NVIDIA T4, L4, or A100) on Google's server for free for a maximum of 12 hours per session. **Please use the free resource fairly** and do not create sessions back-to-back and run upscaling 24/7. This might result in you getting banned. You can get [Colab Pro/Pro+](https://colab.research.google.com/signup/pricing) if you'd like to use better GPUs and get longer runtimes. Usage instructions are embedded in the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gWEwcA9y57EsxwOjmLNmNMXPsafw0kGo).

## [üìñ Documentations](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki)

Video2X's documentations are hosted on this repository's [Wiki page](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki). It includes comprehensive explanations for how to use the [GUI](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki/GUI), the [CLI](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki/CLI), the [container image](https://github.com/K4YT3X/video2x/wiki/Container), the [library](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/wiki/Library), and more. The Wiki is open to edits by the community, so you, yes you, can also correct errors or add new contents to the documentations.

## Introduction

Video2X is a machine-learning-powered framework for video upscaling and frame interpolation, built around three main components:

- [libvideo2x](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/blob/master/src/libvideo2x.cpp): The core C++ library providing upscaling and frame interpolation capabilities.
- [Video2X CLI](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x/blob/master/src/video2x.c): A command-line interface that utilizes `libvideo2x` for video processing.
- [Video2X Qt6](https://github.com/k4yt3x/video2x-qt6): A Qt6-based graphical interface that utilizes `libvideo2x` for video processing.
